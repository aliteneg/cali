        <p>ence CombinPERSONAL SUMMARY
            An ambitious problem solver with a passion for online businesses, and who
            would like to join a team of like-minded developers. Karen has much
            experience of creating logical and innovative solutions to complex problems.
            She is thorough and precise in everything she does, and has a keen interest in
            technology, mobile applications and user experience. As someone who takes
            responsibility for her own personal development, she is continually evaluating
            and upgrading her skills so that she stays at the cutting edge of web
            development. She is a natural problem solver, who has proven herself by
            successfully completing projects for IT consultancies, software houses, web
            design agencies, and IT departments.
            
        
            CAREER STATEMENT
            “I feel that my greatest
            strengths are firstly my strong
            commitment to providing a
            professional service to all
            colleagues with whom I work.
            Secondly my skill at developing
            and maintaining a close
            working relationship with every
            company client, something
            which in turn helps me to gain
            an in-depth understanding of
            their individual needs. Thirdly
            my real passion for Web
            Development as a whole, an
            obsession which allows me to
            spot trends and develop best
            practise processes.”
